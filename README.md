Based on the final project, YelpCamp, from Colt Steele's webdev bootcamp, accessible here: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/

Fully functioning platform for users to post and share coffee spots they've visited; application includes:
- Full CRUD functionality (for posting coffee spots and adding comments)
- Full Authentication and signup capabilities for users
- Database usage for storing coffee spots and comments

This was the first full application I built (Summer/Fall 2016) and was a great learning experience.
